## Introduction

The MAC Address Changer is a Python script that allows users to change the MAC (Media Access Control) address of their network interfaces. A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment. By changing your MAC address, you can enhance your privacy, prevent tracking by advertisers or network administrators, and bypass certain network restrictions. 

Changing your MAC address can be beneficial for various reasons, including testing security measures, maintaining anonymity online, and troubleshooting network issues. This script is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it accessible for individuals with minimal programming knowledge.

**Important Note:** While changing your MAC address can have legitimate uses, it is essential to understand the implications and legality of doing so in your region. Unauthorized changes to a MAC address may violate the terms of service of your internet service provider or local laws. Always use this tool responsibly and ethically.
